    "This notebook downloads episodes using Kaggle's GetEpisodeReplay API and the [Meta Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/kaggle/meta-kaggle) dataset.\n",
    "\n",
    "Meta Kaggle is refreshed daily, and sometimes fails a daily refresh. That's OK, Goose keeps well for 24hr.\n",
    "\n",
    "Why download replays?\n",
    "- Train your ML/RL model\n",
    "- Inspect the performance of yours and others agents\n",
    "- To add to your ever growing json collection \n",
    "\n",
    "Only one scraping strategy is implemented: For each top scoring submission, download all missing matches, move on to next submission.\n",
    "\n",
    "Other scraping strategies can be implemented, but not here. Like download max X matches per submission or per team per day, or ignore certain teams or ignore where some scores < X, or only download some teams.\n",
    "\n",
    "Please let me know of any bugs. It's new, and my goose may be cooked.\n",
